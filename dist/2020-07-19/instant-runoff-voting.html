<h4 id="first-past-the-post">First Past The Post</h4>
<p>With the exception of Maine, each US state votes <em>all</em> its electoral votes for <em>one</em> presidential candidate, no matter how close the election in that state. Consider Florida in 2000. George W Bush won 48.847% of the vote, Al Gore won 48.838%, and Ralph Nader won 1.635% of the vote. For the sake of simpler numbers, let’s say that the breakdown was Bush 49%, Gore 48%, Nader 3%.</p>
<p>Even though Bush won by only one percentage point, all of Florida’s 25 electoral votes went to Bush. This happens even though fewer than 50% of voters voted for Bush.</p>
<p>This kind of electoral system is called <em>First Past The Post</em> (abbreviated FPTP). In a FPTP system, the winner is the candidate who has received the <em>plurality</em> of the votes (the greatest number). It doesn’t matter whether the winner has received a <em>majority</em> of the votes (that is, more than 50% of the votes cast).</p>
<h4 id="wasted-votes-voter-regret-spoilers">Wasted Votes, Voter Regret, Spoilers</h4>
<p>We might (cruelly) say that the voters for Nader have “wasted” their votes. They did not vote for either of the top-two candidates, so the Nader voters neither increased nor decreased Bush’s margin of victory. In a sense, the Nader voters’ participation was superfluous to the final result of the election.</p>
<p>Bush and Gore are (with respect to the American political spectrum) center-right and center-left candidates. Nader is more strongly left-wing. Probably most voters for Nader would have preferred that Gore be elected over Bush. The Florida voters for Nader may <em>regret</em> their vote and wish that they had voted for Gore instead.</p>
<p>If Nader’s voters were able to switch their votes to Gore, Gore would win 51%-to-49%. Because Nader’s candidacy has pulled away enough voters from Gore so that he is in second-place (rather than the winner), we call Nader a “<em>spoiler</em>” candidate. (BTW, when I say “spoiler,” I am not trying to be pejorative.)</p>
<h4 id="two-round-systems">Two-Round Systems</h4>
<p>Some electoral systems try to address this problem by using a <em>two-round</em> electoral system. Under such a system, if no candidate receives a majority of votes in the first round, then a <em>second</em> round is run. The second round consists of only the top two candidates from the first round.</p>
<p>In our example, neither Bush, Gore, nor Nader received a majority (more than 50% of votes). Thus a second round would be run. The top two candidates in the first round were Bush and Gore, so they are selected for the second round. Presuming that the voters for Nader prefer Gore to Bush, they will vote for Gore in the second round. Gore will win 51%-to-49%.</p>
<p>The two-round system tends to reduce “wasted” votes. Every vote in the second round either increases or decreases the winner’s margin of victory – <em>no second round vote is wasted</em>. Effectively, the two round system gives every voter a chance to change their vote to one of the top two candidates.</p>
<p>A single third-party candidate can never act as a spoiler in the two round system, since the potential spoiler is eliminated before the final second round. We will investigate (soon!) what can happen when there are <em>more</em> than three candidates.</p>
<h4 id="where-is-the-two-round-system-used">Where Is The Two-Round System Used?</h4>
<p>When electing the president of a country, the two-round system is very commonly used. France is the classic example.</p>
<p>Most countries do not use single-member legislative districts, so neither FPTP nor two-round systems are applicable. In those countries with single-member districts, FPTP is the more common option (e.g., in the US, UK, Canada). However, France does elect its National Assembly members using the two-round system.</p>
<h4 id="the-problem-with-two-rounds-france-2002">The Problem With Two Rounds: France 2002</h4>
<p>The two-round system is not entirely robust to <em>multiple spoilers</em> when there is a sufficiently strong third party. The best explanation is an example.</p>
<p>Consider the 2002 French presidential election. Most French voters were aligned either with the right or the left. However, a significant minority of 15%-20% of voters were aligned with Marie Le Pen’s far right Front National party.</p>
<p>In the first round, the leading right candidate (Jacques Chirac) won ~20% of the vote. A total of ~36% of first round votes were cast for Chirac and other right candidates. The leading left candidate (Lionel Jospin) won 16.18% of the vote. A total of ~45% of the first round votes were cast for Jospin and other left candidates.</p>
<p>Le Pen won 16.86% of the vote. Thus Le Pen came in second, Jospin in third. Jospin was eliminated (along with all other left candidates), even though parties of the left (in aggregate) had a significant lead over the parties of the right.</p>
<p>In the second round, Chirac beat Le Pen 82%-to-18%. One campaign poster encouraged left voters to vote for Chirac: “Vote for the crook, not the fascist.”</p>
<h4 id="diagnosing-the-two-round-problem">Diagnosing The Two-Round Problem</h4>
<p>The problem here was that the left had wide but fragmented support. Chirac and Le Pen had focused support. The wide variety of left candidates split the left vote, spoiling Jospin’s ability to advance to the second round. If Jospin had advanced to face Chirac tête-à-tête, he presumably would have won!</p>
<p>Our French example demonstrates that the two-round system can <em>waste votes in the first round</em>. Left voters who voted for anyone other than Jospin in the first round “wasted” their vote. Many probably regret it. They wish they had voted for Jospin to decrease (to overcome!) his first round deficit to Le Pen. They regret not helping Jospin advance to the final round.</p>
<p>Taking a different perspective: it was “premature” for the two-round system to assume that left, non-Jospin voters would regret not voting for one of the <em>top two</em> first-round candidates (Chirac, Le Pen). Their true regret was in not voting for the third place candidate (Jospin)!</p>
<h4 id="fixing-the-two-round-problem-more-rounds">Fixing The Two-Round Problem: More Rounds!</h4>
<p>We’ve identified the problem with the two-round system. It eliminates too many candidates too quickly. To fix things, we need to have <em>more rounds</em>, each round eliminating <em>as few</em> candidates as possible.</p>
<p>Specifically: we will eliminate candidates one-at-a-time. In our fixed system, we will eliminate the bottom-ranked candidate and have voters vote again. We will keep repeating until there are only two candidates left.</p>
<p>We know that in the final round, no votes are wasted because there are only two candidates left. Are votes wasted in earlier rounds? In round <span class="math inline"><em>k</em></span>, imagine that candidate X is eliminated. Voters for any other candidate Y did not waste their vote: their vote increased Y’s margin of victory over eliminated candidate X. Y’s voters have helped Y not get eliminated.</p>
<p>Also, the voters for X did not waste their ballot. They were making X’s deficit as small as possible. Their vote was helping (albeit unsuccessfully) keep X in the race.</p>
<p>It is true that X is eliminated, but X’s supporters can always vote for any other candidate in the next round. They lost nothing by supporting X in round <span class="math inline"><em>k</em></span> - they get another vote in round <span class="math inline"><em>k</em> + 1</span>!</p>
<p>Imagine what would happen if we applied this system to the French 2002 election. The less popular candidates of the left and right would be one-by-one eliminated. As these candidates are eliminated, the vote share of the leading candidates (Jospin and Chirac) will rise. Le Pen’s vote share will never rise appreciably above his initial 16.68%, since his support comes only from within the fringe FN party.</p>
<p>Thus Le Pen would eventually be eliminated in the second-to-last round. The final round would be a head-to-head of Jospin and Chirac.</p>
<h4 id="automating-a-multiple-round-system-instant-runoff-voting">Automating A Multiple-Round System: Instant Runoff Voting</h4>
<p>We know that the two-round system is practical, because nations like France use it. But what about our multiple-round variant? If there are 12 candidates, there will be 11 rounds. Must the electorate come out and vote in each of 11 rounds on 11 different days? Could we somehow streamline a multiple-round system into just a single event?</p>
<p>Yes. The simplest solution is this: ask each voter to <em>rank</em> all candidates on their ballot. In the initial round, we count all the first-rank votes. We eliminate the bottom candidate. In our Florida example, Nader is eliminated first.</p>
<p>We now “simulate” a second round. We count votes again, but we treat a first-rank Nader supporter’s vote as if it were submitted for the voter’s second-ranked candidate. That is: we <em>transfer</em> a Nader supporter’s vote to their second choice. We assume that Nader voters would rank Gore second. In the simulated second round, Nader’s votes transfer to Gore.</p>
<p>Thus, in the simulated second round Gore wins his 48% of first-rank votes plus the 3% of the Nader supporters’ second-rank votes. This gives Gore his 51%-49% victory over Bush.</p>
<p>If there had been <span class="math inline"><em>N</em> &gt; 3</span> candidates in our example, we would “simulate” more rounds: <span class="math inline"><em>N</em> − 1</span> of them! Note an “optimization:” we can always stop simulating rounds as soon as a candidate obtains a majority of the vote (greater than 50% of the vote). If a candidate has more than 50% of the vote in round <span class="math inline"><em>k</em></span>, then they will have a majority in every round subsequent to <span class="math inline"><em>k</em></span>.</p>
<p>Methods that ask voters to <em>rank</em> candidates are called <em>ranked choice</em> systems (there are many such systems). The particular ranked choice system we’ve described here is simply an automation of the multiple-round system we’ve described above. This system is called <em>Instant Runoff Voting</em> (abbreviated <em>IRV</em>).</p>
<h4 id="where-is-instant-runoff-voting-used">Where Is Instant Runoff Voting Used?</h4>
<p>Instant Runoff Voting is the system that is used to elect the mayor of San Francisco. It is used to elect members of the lower house of Australia’s parliament (since 1919!). Maine will use IRV in 2020 when it votes for president.</p>
<h4 id="instant-runoff-voting-an-example">Instant Runoff Voting: An Example</h4>
<p>Let’s work an example to see IRV in action.</p>
<p>We should first note: when there are exactly three candidates, instant runoff voting is always exactly identical to the two-round system. We worked the Bush/Gore/Nader example already. So let’s do a more complicated one!</p>
<p>Let us say that five candidates run for mayor in San Francisco. Alice receives 30% of first-rank votes, Bob receives 25% of first-rank votes, Candice receives 20% of first-rank votes, David receives 15% of votes, and Eve receives 10% of first-rank votes.</p>
<p>If San Francisco used the FPTP method, Alice would win. If San Francisco used the two-round system, all but Alice and Bob would be eliminated. Depending on how first-rank supporters of Candice, David, and Eve ranked Alice and Bob, either could candidate could win.</p>
<p>Using IRV, Eve is eliminated first, because she has received the fewest number of first-rank votes. Let’s imagine that David’s platform is very similar to Eve’s. Everyone who ranked Eve first has ranked David <em>second</em>. Thus, after elimination of Eve, all her supporters’ votes transfer to David. His share of the vote increases to 25%.</p>
<p>The vote share for Alice/Bob/Candice/David is now 30/25/20/25. Candice is the next candidate eliminated. Of her supporters, let us imagine that some prefer Alice, others prefer Bob, but that David is most popular amongst Candice’s supporters. Lets say that Candice’s supporters split 5/5/10 for Alice/Bob/David.</p>
<p>Now Alice has 35% of the vote, Bob has 30% of the vote, and David has 35% of the vote. We eliminate Bob next. Let us say that his votes transfer 10% to Alice, and 20% to David. Note that some voters who had ranked Candice first and Bob second are having their votes transferred a <em>second time</em>!</p>
<p>Now that there are only two candidates remaining, the vote tally in the final round is 45% for Alice and 55% for David. David wins!</p>
<h4 id="how-much-would-irv-reduce-spoiling-in-us-elections">How Much Would IRV Reduce Spoiling In US Elections?</h4>
<p>We’ve shown already that the two-round system would have avoided the spoiling problem in Florida 2000. The two-round system works well when there are only two widely-supported candidates. This is the typical case within the US two-party default. IRV is “overkill” if the two candidates that get the most first-round votes always go on to the final IRV round. However, if the US were to develop a strong third-party, IRV would be helpful just as it would have been in the 2002 French election.</p>
<p>It would be nice if voters could vote their conscience in a first-round. I think it’s undesirable in FPTP that a candidate like Nader “shouldn’t” run simply because they might spoil another candidate’s victory.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I would not want to overdramatize the failure of FPTP with respect to spoilers. Given the two-party system that prevails in the United States, voters can easily identify the top two general election candidates. To avoid wasting their ballot, they can vote for one of the top two candidates, even if neither are their true first choice. Voters do this all the time.</p>
<p>Also: in the American two-party system, third party candidates are marginal enough that they attract relatively few votes. Thus third party candidates can “spoil” only elections that were already very close. Nader spoiled an election which was basically 49%/49%/2%. If there had been a small tornado in Jacksonville, Bush would have lost. If there had been a flood in Miami, it wouldn’t matter what Nader voters did: Gore would have lost.</p>
<p>When an election result is close enough that it is not robust to random but typical events, the injustice of getting an election “wrong” is less. In my opinion, the greater tragedy of Florida 2000 was that 49% of voters wanted to vote for Bush. I hesitate to blame FPTP and Nader too much.</p>
<h4 id="voter-regret-head-to-head-elections-and-condorcet-winners">Voter Regret, Head-To-Head Elections, and Condorcet Winners</h4>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: Reconsider. I haven’t reviewed past here. I’ve reviewed and liked everything prior.</p>
<p>Let us say that voters for Nader prefer Gore over Markov. Perhaps Markov and Nader represent political extremes, while Gore is a centrist candidate. Given the vote breakdown, Nader voters would have done better to vote for Gore rather than Nader. By switching their vote they could put Gore in the lead 55%-to-45%.</p>
<p>It feels undesirable that Nader voters <em>regret</em> their vote for Nader (wish they could change their vote to Gore). It gets worse. If Gore represents the political center, then Markov voters probably prefer Gore to Nader. In that case, Gore would win a head-to-head race against Nader 80%-to-20%.</p>
<p>Gore would beat <em>every other candidate</em> if he were in a head-to-head race with them. We call Gore the <em>Condorcet winner</em> of the election. There can be only (at most) one Condorcet winner in an election.</p>
<p>Speaking loosely/imprecisely, the Condorcet winner (when there is one), is the single candidate that “a majority” agrees is better than every other candidate. It seems a shame that FPTP can fail to elect the Condorcet winner (as in our example).</p>
<h4 id="irv-may-not-particularly-help-centrist-candidates">IRV May Not Particularly Help Centrist Candidates</h4>
<p>Where a polarized two-party system prevails, instant runoff voting does not significantly help centrist candidates. Imagine a polarized country where diametrically opposed candidates A and B both command 40% first-rank support. Centrist voters can vote for candidate C, but because C is not popular enough to win more first-rank votes, they will be the first eliminated under IRV. One of the two polarizing candidates (A or B) will be elected (after C’s votes are redistributed).</p>
<p>IRV <em>might</em> incentivize candidates A and B to appeal to supporters of candidate C. It <em>might</em> encourage parties A and B to nominate candidates who will win C’s votes (after redistribution). But (in theory) the two party FPTP system already encourages parties to choose candidates who appeal to the center.</p>
<p>In conclusion: I would not expect IRV to greatly help American candidates with broad but tepid support. On the other hand, IRV wouldn’t <em>harm</em> centrists/compromise candidates.</p>
<h4 id="irv-could-help-when-there-are-many-candidates">IRV Could Help When There Are Many Candidates</h4>
<p>I think the real value of instant runoff voting is in elections where there are a large number of candidates, many of whom share supporters.</p>
<p>We already discussed the 2002 French presidential election. Let’s consider a second, hypothetical scenario. Imagine a world where there are 12 American primary contestants, 11 of whom are near-facsimiles of each other. A 12th candidate is named Donald Trump. In this crazy world, IRV is not used in presidential primaries. You want to vote against Donald Trump. Who do you vote for?</p>
<p>Do you vote for the candidate you most like? That could help your favorite candidate build visibility and momentum, even if they lose your state’s primary (maybe even getting no delegates).</p>
<p>Important question: is your state a winner-take-all primary? If so, you probably should vote for the non-Trump candidate with the strongest support. Without the other candidates’ voters banding together, Donald Trump will win all the delegates in your state.</p>
<p>But how can you identify the non-Trump consensus candidate? The more similar the leading non-Trump candidates are, the harder it will be for never-Trump voters to pick and rally around just one of those candidates. Also, candidates have a strong personal incentive (professional advancement) not to withdraw unless it is obvious they cannot win.</p>
<p>At least one analysis suggests that <a href="https://www.fairvote.org/simulating_instant_runoff_flips_most_donald_trump_primary_victories">IRV flips most Donald Trump Primary Victories</a>.</p>
<h4 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>IRV has some advantages (and no obvious disadvantages) when compared with FPTP.</li>
<li>Introducing IRV probably wouldn’t fundamentally change the two party dynamic that prevails in American general elections. IRV would eliminate third party candidates and the election would mostly reduce to the two main parties (as is already the case).</li>
<li>IRV would presumably reduce the spoiler effect in closely contested general elections. This is nice, but not vital. Third-party spoilers in the US tend to have low support, so only already contentious FPTP elections can be spoiled.</li>
<li>Introducing IRV could reduce the probability that extremist candidates are selected in <em>primary</em> elections (where there can be many similar candidates).</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="future-discussion">Future Discussion</h4>
<p>There are many other kinds of electoral systems. In the future, I’d like to review/consider other systems that achieve <em>proportional</em> outcomes. That is: if 40% of the electorate support party A and 60% support party B, then a <em>multi-member district</em> of <em>ten</em> seats will elect 4 members of party A and 6 members of party B.</p>
<p>Examples systems that achieve this are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Party-List Proportional Representation (most legislatures are elected this way),</li>
<li>Single Transferrable Vote (Irish legislature elected this way)</li>
</ol>
<p>countries organize their federal government. For example: did you know On a related note: I’d like to consider and review ways that other that most European countries are run by a coalition government? I’d like to talk about how that works, and what the advantages of such systems might be.</p>
