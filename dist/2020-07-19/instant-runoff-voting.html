When an election is held for the congressional district, only one candidate can win the election. The winner is the person who receives the greatest number of votes.</p>
<p>If 45% of votes are for Markov, 35% of votes are for Curie, and 20% of votes are for Gizmo, then Markov wins the election and is elected congressperson. This happens even though fewer than 50% of voters voted for Markov.</p>
<h4 id="first-past-the-post">First Past The Post</h4>
<p>This kind of electoral system is called <em>First Past The Post</em> (abbreviated FPTP). In a FPTP system, the winner is the candidate who has received the <em>plurality</em> of the votes (the greatest number). It doesn’t matter whether the winner has received a <em>majority</em> of the votes (that is, more than 50% of the votes cast).</p>
<p>Perhaps the 20% of voters who voted for Gizmo would have preferred that Curie be elected rather than Markov. That is: if the election had been held “head-to-head” between Markov and Curie, Curie would have defeated Markov 55%-to-45%.</p>
<p>This circumstance feels unfortunate. Would it not be better if Curie were chosen as congressperson?</p>
<h4 id="two-round-systems">Two-Round Systems</h4>
<p>Some electoral systems try to address this problem by using the <em>two-round</em> electoral system. Under this system, if no candidate receives a majority, then a <em>second</em> round is run. The second round consists of only the top two candidates from the first round.</p>
<p>In our example, since neither Markov, Curie, nor Gizmo received a majority (more than 50% of votes), a second round would be run. The top two candidates in the first round were Markov and Curie, so they are selected for the second round. Presuming that the voters for Gizmo prefer Curie to Markov, Curie will win 55%-to-45%. Curie wins!</p>
<p>The two-round system is very commonly used throughout the world. It is a very common way to elect the president of a country. France is one example.</p>
<p>Most countries do not use single-member legislative districts, so neither FPTP nor two round systems are applicable. In those countries with single-member districts, FPTP is the more common option. However, France does elect its National Assembly members using the two-round system.</p>
<h4 id="automating-a-two-round-system">Automating A Two Round System</h4>
<p>A two-round system can require that two rounds of election be held. This could be burdensome to the electorate. They must come out to vote in a second election! Is there an easy way to eliminate the need for the second round?</p>
<p>The simplest solution is this: ask each voter to <em>rank</em> all candidates on the ballot. We then count all the first-rank votes. If there is a majority winner then they are elected.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we eliminate all but the top two candidates. In our example, Gizmo would be eliminated. We count each ballot for the more preferred of the two remaining candidates. Votes for Gizmo are “transferred” to Curie and Markov depending on who the Gizmo voter ranks more highly.</p>
<p>This system is called <em>contingent voting</em>. It is simply an “automation” of a standard two round system. I am not aware that contingent voting is used anywhere. That is because a better alternative exists.</p>
<h4 id="the-problem-with-two-rounds">The Problem With Two Rounds</h4>
<p>What if a candidate would win every head-to-head matchup of candidates, but is <em>not</em> amongst the top-two candidates if you only consider voters’ first choice? In such a scenario, both the two round and contingent voting systems would “prematurely” jump to eliminating all but the top-two first-choice candidates. This would be a “mistake” because an eliminated candidate would defeat either of the “top-two” candidates in a head-to-head election.</p>
<p>A fanciful scenario? Consider the 2002 French presidential election. In the first round the Gaullist (right) candidate Chirac won ~20% of the vote. The far-right candidate Le Pen won 16.86%. The Socialist candidate Jospin came third with 16.18% of the vote and was eliminated. Various less popular candidates of the left won a total of 28.59% of the first-round vote, but all these were also eliminated.</p>
<p>Chirac beat Le Pen 82%-to-18% in the second round (one campaign poster read: “vote for the crook, not the fascist”). Had Jospin entered the second round instead of Le Pen, who knows whether Jospin would have defeated Chirac? It is probable that the French electorate would have preferred Jospin to Chirac and indeed <em>every</em> other presidential candidate.</p>
<p>If so, it seems undesirable that the two round system did not elect Jospin.</p>
<h4 id="instant-runoff-voting">Instant Runoff Voting</h4>
<p>I now want to introduce you to an improved version of contingent voting: <em>instant runoff voting</em> (IRV). It is the system that is used to elect the mayor of San Francisco. It is used to elect members of the lower house of Australia. Maine will use IRV in 2020 when it votes for president.</p>
<p>When there are <span class="math inline"><em>N</em></span> candidates, IRV does not eliminate <span class="math inline"><em>N</em> − 2</span> candidates all in one go. IRV runs <span class="math inline"><em>N</em> − 1</span> rounds, eliminating candidates one at a time. In each round, each voter’s ballot is counted toward their top-ranked candidate, excluding candidates who have previously been eliminated. At the end of the round, the candidate with the fewest number of votes is eliminated. Another round is run, and a next candidate is eliminated.</p>
<p>The process ends when a candidate receives a majority (more than 50%) of votes. This is the winner.</p>
<h4 id="instant-runoff-voting-an-example">Instant Runoff Voting: An Example</h4>
<p>We should first note: when there are exactly three candidates, instant runoff voting is identical to the two round system.</p>
<p>Let us say that five candidates run for mayor in San Francisco. Alice receives 30% of first-choice votes, Bob receives 25% of first-choice votes, Candice receives 20% of first-choice votes, David receives 15% of votes, and Eve receives 10% of first-choice votes.</p>
<p>If San Francisco used the FPTP method, Alice would win. If San Francisco used the two round system, all but Alice and Bob would be eliminated. Depending on how first-choice supporters of Candice, David, and Eve ranked Alice and Bob, either could candidate could win.</p>
<p>Using IRV, Eve is eliminated first, because she has received the fewest number of first-choice votes. Let’s imagine that David’s platform is very similar to Eve’s. Everyone who ranked Eve first has ranked David <em>second</em>. Thus, after elimination of Eve, all her supporters’ votes transfer to David. His share of the vote increases to 25%.</p>
<p>Still, no one has a majority of votes. Candice is the next candidate eliminated. Of her supporters, let us imagine that some prefer Alice, others prefer Bob, but that David is most popular amongst Candice’s supporters. Lets say that Candice’s supporters splice 5/5/10 for Alice/Bob/David.</p>
<p>Now Alice has 35% of the vote, Bob has 30% of the vote, and David has 35% of the vote. We eliminate Bob next. Let us say that his votes transfer 5% to Alice, and 25% to David. Note that some voters who had ranked Candice first and Bob second are having their votes transferred a <em>second time</em>!</p>
<p>Now that there are only two candidates remaining, the vote tally in the final round is 40% for Alice and 60% for David. David wins!</p>
<h4 id="irv-reduces-the-spoiler-effect">IRV Reduces The “Spoiler Effect”</h4>
<p>IRV reduces the “spoiler effect” in close elections. Votes for a marginal candidate will be redistributed when the candidate is eliminated. For example: if IRV had been used in the 2000 presidential election, votes for Ralph Nader would have (most likely) been redistributed to Al Gore. Al Gore would likely have defeated George W. Bush.</p>
<p>In a cruel sense, votes for Nader were “wasted” in Florida, because a vote for Nader neither increased nor decreased the victory margin for the candidate with the plurality (Bush). Under IRV, votes are never wasted in this way, because a vote is always transferred to one of the two final candidates. IRV typically doesn’t penalize a voter to rank their first choice according to their conscience. This is good.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I would not want to overdramatize the failure of FPTP. Voters can identify the top two general election candidates easily in the two party system that prevails in the United States. It is a simple (and common) strategy for voters to vote for one of the top two candidates even if these are not their first choice.</p>
<p>Lastly, in the American system, third party candidates are marginal enough that they attract relatively few votes. Thus third party candidates can “spoil” only elections that were already very close (like the 2000 election in Florida). The narrower the margin of support between the two top candidates, the less the spoiler effect “subverts the will of the people,” since there is not in fact any consensus on a best candidate.</p>
<h4 id="irv-does-not-particularly-help-centrist-candidates">IRV Does Not Particularly Help Centrist Candidates</h4>
<p>Where a two-party system prevails, instant runoff voting does not significantly help centrist candidates. Imagine a polarized country where diametrically opposed candidates A and B both command 40% first-rank support. Centrist voters can vote for candidate C, but because C is not popular enough to win more first-rank votes, they will be the first eliminated under IRV. One of the two polarizing candidates (A or B) will be elected (after C’s votes are redistributed).</p>
<p>IRV <em>might</em> incentivize candidates A and B to appeal to supporters of candidate C. It <em>might</em> encourage parties A and B to nominate candidates who will win C’s votes (after redistribution). But (in theory) the two party FPTP system already encourages parties to choose candidates who appeal to the center.</p>
<p>In conclusion: I would not expect IRV to greatly help American candidates with broad but tepid support. On the other hand, IRV wouldn’t <em>harm</em> centrists/compromise candidates.</p>
<h4 id="irv-could-help-when-there-are-many-candidates">IRV Could Help When There Are Many Candidates</h4>
<p>I think the real value of instant runoff voting is in elections where there are a large number of candidates, many of whom share supporters.</p>
<p>We already discussed the 2002 French presidential election. Let’s consider a second, hypothetical scenario. Imagine a world where there are 12 American primary contestants, 11 of whom are near-facsimiles of each other. A 12th candidate is named Donald Trump. In this crazy world, IRV is not used in presidential primaries. You want to vote against Donald Trump. Who do you vote for?</p>
<p>Do you vote for the candidate you most like? That could help your favorite candidate build visibility and momentum, even if they lose your state’s primary (maybe even getting no delegates).</p>
<p>Important question: is your state a winner-take-all primary? If so, you probably should vote for the non-Trump candidate with the strongest support. Without the other candidates’ voters banding together, Donald Trump will win all the delegates in your state.</p>
<p>But how can you identify the non-Trump consensus candidate? The more similar the leading non-Trump candidates are, the harder it will be for never-Trump voters to pick and rally around just one of those candidates. Also, candidates have a strong personal incentive (professional advancement) not to withdraw unless it is obvious they cannot win.</p>
<p>At least one analysis suggests that <a href="https://www.fairvote.org/simulating_instant_runoff_flips_most_donald_trump_primary_victories">IRV flips most Donald Trump Primary Victories</a>.</p>
<h4 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>IRV has some advantages (and no obvious disadvantages) when compared with FPTP.</li>
<li>Introducing IRV probably wouldn’t fundamentally change the two party dynamic that prevails in American general elections. IRV would eliminate third party candidates and the election would mostly reduce to the two main parties (as is already the case).</li>
<li>IRV would presumably reduce the spoiler effect in closely contested general elections. This is nice, but not vital. Third-party spoilers in the US tend to have low support, so only already contentious FPTP elections can be spoiled.</li>
<li>Introducing IRV could reduce the probability that extremist candidates are selected in <em>primary</em> elections (where there can be many similar candidates).</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="future-discussion">Future Discussion</h4>
<p>There are many other kinds of electoral systems. In the future, I’d like to review/consider other systems that achieve <em>proportional</em> outcomes. That is: if 40% of the electorate support party A and 60% support party B, then a <em>multi-member district</em> of <em>ten</em> seats will elect 4 members of party A and 6 members of party B.</p>
<p>Examples systems that achieve this are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Party-List Proportional Representation (most legislatures are elected this way),</li>
<li>Single Transferrable Vote (Irish legislature elected this way)</li>
</ol>
<p>countries organize their federal government. For example: did you know On a related note: I’d like to consider and review ways that other that most European countries are run by a coalition government? I’d like to talk about how that works, and what the advantages of such systems might be.</p>
