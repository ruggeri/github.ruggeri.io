<p>In the United States there is one congressperson per congressional district. When an election is held for the congressional district, only one candidate can win the election. The winner is the person who receives the greatest number of votes.</p>
<p>If 45% of votes are for Markov, 35% of votes are for Curie, and 20% of votes are for Gizmo, then Markov wins the election and is elected congressperson. This happens even though fewer than 50% of voters voted for Markov.</p>
<p>This system is called <strong>First Past The Post</strong> (FPTP). In FPTP, the winner is the candidate who has received the <em>plurality</em> of the votes (the greatest number). It doesn’t matter whether the winner has received a <em>majority</em> of the votes (that is, more than 50% of the votes).</p>
<p>Perhaps the 20% of voters who voted for Gizmo would have preferred that Curie be elected rather than Markov. That is: if the election were “head-to-head” between Markov and Curie, Curie would have defeated Markov 55%-to-45%.</p>
<p>This circumstance feels unfortunate. Would it not be better if Curie were chosen as congressperson?</p>
<h4 id="two-round-systems-2rs">Two-Round Systems (2RS)</h4>
<p>Some electoral systems try to address this problem by using a <strong>two-round</strong> (2RS) electoral system. Under this system, if no candidate receives a majority, then a <em>second</em> round is run. The second round consists of only the top two candidates from the first round.</p>
<p>In our example, since neither Markov, Curie, nor Gizmo received a majority (50%+ of votes), a second round would be run. The top two candidates in the first round were Markov and Curie, so they are selected for the second round. Presuming that the voters for Gizmo prefer Curie to Markov, Curie will win 55%-to-45%. Curie wins!</p>
<p>The two-round system is very commonly used throughout the world. It is a very common way to elect the president of a country. France is one example. 2RS is not widely used to elect members of a legislature. FPTP is more common, though France does elect its National Assembly members using the two-round system.</p>
<h4 id="contingent-voting">Contingent Voting</h4>
<p>A two-round system can require that two rounds of election be held. This could be burdensome to the electorate. Is there an easy way to eliminate the need for the second round?</p>
<p>The simplest solution is this: ask each voter to <em>rank</em> all candidates on the ballot. We then count all the first-rank votes. If there is a majority winner then they are elected.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we eliminate all but the top two candidates. In our example, Gizmo would be eliminated. We count each ballot for the more preferred of the two remaining candidates. In effect, we have “automatically” run the second round.</p>
<p>This system is called <strong>contingent voting</strong>. To my knowledge, it is not used anywhere.</p>
<h4 id="instant-runoff-voting">Instant Runoff Voting</h4>
<p>I want to introduce you to an improved version of contingent voting: <strong>instant runoff voting</strong>. It is the system that is used to elect the mayor of San Francisco. It is used to elect members of the lower house of Australia. Maine will use IRV in 2020 when it votes for president.</p>
<p>IRV is a slight twist on contingent voting. It (attempts to) solve a problem: what if a candidate would win every head-to-head matchup of candidates, but is <em>not</em> amongst the top-two candidates if you only consider voters’ first choice? In such a scenario, both 2RS and contingent voting would “prematurely” jump to a conclusion by eliminating all but the top-two first-choice candidates.</p>
<p>If there are <span class="math inline"><em>N</em></span> candidates, IRV does not eliminate <span class="math inline"><em>N</em> − 2</span> in one go. IRV eliminates candidates one-at-a-time. A series of rounds are run. In each round, each ballot is counted toward the top-ranked remaining candidate. The candidate with the fewest number of votes is eliminated. Another round is run, and a next candidate is eliminated.</p>
<p>The process ends when a candidate receives a majority (50%+) of votes. This is the winner.</p>
<h4 id="irv-an-example">IRV: An Example</h4>
<p>Let us say that five candidates run for mayor in San Francisco. Alice receives 30% of first-choice votes, Bob receives 25% of first-choice votes, Candice receives 20% of first-choice votes, David receives 15% of votes, and Eve receives 10% of first-choice votes.</p>
<p>Eve is eliminated first, because she has received the fewest number of first-choice votes. Let’s imagine that David’s platform is very similar to Eve’s. Everyone who ranked Eve first has ranked David <em>second</em>. Thus, after elimination of Eve, all her supporters’ votes transfer to David. His share of the vote increases to 25%.</p>
<p>Still, no one has a majority of votes. Candice is the next candidate eliminated. Of her supporters, let us imagine that some prefer Alice, others prefer Bob, but that David is most popular amongst Candice’s supporters. Lets say that Candice’s supporters splice 5/5/10 for Alice/Bob/David.</p>
<p>Now Alice has 35% of the vote, Bob has 30% of the vote, and David has 35% of the vote. We finally eliminate Bob. Let us say that his votes transfer 5% to Alice, and 25% to David. The final vote tally is 40% for Alice and 60% for David. David wins!</p>
<h4 id="irv-reduces-the-spoiler-effect">IRV Reduces The “Spoiler Effect”</h4>
<p>IRV reduces the “spoiler effect” in close elections. Votes for a marginal candidate will be redistributed when the candidate is eliminated. For example: if IRV had been used in the 2000 presidential election, votes for Ralph Nader would have (most likely) been redistributed to Al Gore, and he would have defeated George W. Bush.</p>
<p>I think IRV is valuable here, though I would argue that the failure of FPTP is not so extreme because the strategy of identifying and voting for one of the top-two candidates is clear.</p>
<h4 id="irv-does-not-particularly-help-centrist-candidates">IRV Does Not Particularly Help Centrist Candidates</h4>
<p>IRV does not significantly help centrist candidates to be elected. Imagine a polarized country where diametrically opposed candidates A and B both command 40% first-rank support. Centrist voters can vote for candidate C, but because C is not inspiring enough to win enough first-rank votes, they will be the first eliminated under IRV. One of the two polarizing candidates (A or B) will be elected (after C’s votes are redistributed).</p>
<p>IRV <em>might</em> incentivize candidates A and B to appeal to supporters of candidate C. It <em>might</em> encourage parties A and B to nominate candidates who will win C’s votes. But (in theory) the two party FPTP system already encourages parties to choose more centrist candidates.</p>
<h4 id="irv-could-help-when-there-are-many-candidates">IRV Could Help When There Are Many Candidates</h4>
<p>I think the real value of IRV is in elections where there are a large number of candidates, many of whom share supporters.</p>
<p>Imagine a world where there are 12 primary contestants, 11 of whom are near-facsimiles of each other. A 12th candidate is named Donald Trump. In this crazy world, IRV is not used in presidential primaries. You want to vote against Donald Trump. Who do you vote for?</p>
<p>Do you vote for the candidate you most like? That could help your favorite candidate build visibility and momentum, even if they lose your state’s primary (maybe even getting no delegates).</p>
<p>Important question: is your state a winner-take-all primary? If so, you probably should vote for the non-Trump candidate with the strongest support. Without the other candidates’ voters banding together, Donald Trump will win all the delegates in your state.</p>
<p>At least one analysis suggests <a href="https://www.fairvote.org/simulating_instant_runoff_flips_most_donald_trump_primary_victories">IRV flips most Donald Trump Primary Victories</a>.</p>
<h4 id="future-discussion">Future Discussion</h4>
<p>IRV is, in my opinion, a much more sane default than FPTP for single-member districts.</p>
<p>However, there are many other kinds of systems. I’d like to review/consider other systems that achieve <em>proportional</em> outcomes. That is: if 40% of the electorate support party A and 60% support party B, then a district of 10 seats will elect 4 members of party A and 6 members of party B.</p>
<p>Election systems I’d like to discuss in the future include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Party-List Proportional Representation (most legislatures are elected this way),</li>
<li>Single Transferrable Vote (Irish legislature elected this way)</li>
</ol>
<p>I’d also like to consider and review ways that other countries organize their federal government. For example: did you know that most European countries are run by a coalition government? I’d like to talk about how that works, and what the advantages of such systems might be.</p><p><a href="/">&lt;&lt; Back To The Posts Index! &lt;&lt;</a></p></div></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-12"><div id="comments"></div><p><a href="/">&lt;&lt;&lt; Back To The Posts Index! &lt;&lt;&lt;</a></p></div></div></div><script src="/ui/dist/main.js"></script><script>hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();</script></body>
