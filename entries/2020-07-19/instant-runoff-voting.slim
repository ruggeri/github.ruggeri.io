  #### First Past The Post

  With the exception of Maine, US states vote all their electoral votes
  for the same presidential candidate, no matter how close the election.
  Consider Florida in 2000. George W Bush won 48.847% of the vote, Al
  Gore won 48.838%, and Ralph Nader won 1.635% of the vote. For the sake
  of simplicity, let's assume the breakdown was Bush 49%, Gore 48%,
  Nader 3%.

  Even though Bush won by only 1 percentage point, all of Florida's 25
  electoral votes went to Bush. This happens even though fewer than 50%
  of voters voted for Bush.

  This kind of electoral system is called *First Past The Post*
  (abbreviated FPTP). In a FPTP system, the winner is the candidate who
  has received the *plurality* of the votes (the greatest number). It
  doesn't matter whether the winner has received a *majority* of the
  votes (that is, more than 50% of the votes cast).

  #### Wasted Votes, Voter Regret, Spoilers

  We might (cruelly) say that the voters for Nader have "wasted" their
  votes. They did not vote for either of the top-two candidates, so the
  Nader voters neither increased nor decreased Bush's margin of victory.
  In a sense, the Nader voters' participation was superfluous to the
  final result of the election.

  Perhaps the voters for Nader would have preferred that Gore be elected
  over Bush. Bush and Gore are right and left candidates, while Nader is
  more progressive than Gore. The Florida voters for Nader may *regret*
  their vote and wish that they had voted for Gore instead.

  If Nader's voters were able to switch their votes to Gore, Gore would
  win 51%-to-49%. Because Nader has pulled away enough voters from Gore
  so that he is in second-place (rather than the winner), we call Nader
  a *spoiler* candidate.

  The possibility for voter regret and spoiler candidates is a negative
  attribute of FPTP.

  #### Two-Round Systems

  Some electoral systems try to address this problem by using the
  *two-round* electoral system. Under this system, if no candidate
  receives a majority, then a *second* round is run. The second round
  consists of only the top two candidates from the first round.

  In our example, since neither Bush, Gore, nor Nader received a
  majority (more than 50% of votes), a second round would be run. The
  top two candidates in the first round were Bush and Gore, so they are
  selected for the second round. Presuming that the voters for Nader
  prefer Gore to Bush, Gore will win 51%-to-49%. Gore wins.

  The two round system tends to reduce "wasted" votes. Every vote in the
  second round either increases or decreases the winner's margin of
  victory -- *no second round vote is wasted*. Effectively, the two
  round system gives every voter a chance to change their vote to one of
  the top two candidates.

  A single third-party candidate cannot act as a spoiler in the two
  round system, since the potential spoiler is eliminated before the
  final second round. In a strongly two-party system (like in America),
  it is difficult for even multiple third-party candidates to spoil a
  two round election. We shall see, however, that spoiling is still
  possible if there is a strong enough third party!

  The two-round system is very commonly used throughout the world. It is
  almost universally used for electing the president of a country.
  France is the classic example.

  Most countries do not use single-member legislative districts at all,
  so neither FPTP nor two round systems are applicable. In those
  countries with single-member districts, FPTP is the more common
  option. However, France does elect its National Assembly members using
  the two-round system.

  #### The Problem With Two Rounds: A French Example

  The two round system is not robust when there are *multiple spoilers*
  and there is a sufficiently strong third party. The best explanation
  is an example.

  Consider the 2002 French presidential election. Most French voters
  were aligned either with the right or the left. However, a significant
  minority of 15%-20% of voters were aligned with Marie Le Pen's far
  right Front National party.

  In the first round, the leading right candidate (Jacques Chirac) won
  ~20% of the vote. A total of ~36% of first round votes were cast for
  Chirac and other right candidates. The leading left candidate (Lionel
  Jospin) won 16.18% of the vote. A total of ~45% of the first round
  votes were cast for Jospin and other left candidates.

  Le Pen won 16.86% of the vote. Thus Le Pen came in second, Jospin in
  third. Jospin was eliminated (along with all other left candidates),
  even though parties of the left (in aggregate) had a significant lead
  over the parties of the right.

  In the second round, Chirac beat Le Pen 82%-to-18%. One campaign
  poster encouraged left voters to vote for Chirac: "Vote for the crook,
  not the fascist."

  The problem here was that the left had wide but fragmented support.
  Chirac and Le Pen had focused support. The wide variety of left
  candidates split the left vote, spoiling Jospin's ability to advance
  to the second round. If Jospin had advanced to face Chirac
  tête-à-tête, he presumably would have won!

  #### Diagnosing The Two Round Problem

  The problem is that the two round system can *waste votes in the first
  round*. Left voters who voted for anyone other than Jospin in the
  first round "wasted" their vote. Many probably regret it. They wish
  they had voted for Jospin to decrease (to overcome!) his first round
  deficit to Le Pen. They regret not keeping Jospin alive until the
  final round.

  Taking a different perspective: it was "premature" for the two round
  system to assume that left, non-Jospin voters would regret not voting
  for one of the *top two* candidates. Their true regret was in not
  voting for the third place candidate (Jospin)!

  #### Fixing The Two Round Problem: More Rounds!

  We've identified the problem with the two round system. It eliminates
  too many candidates too quickly. To fix things, we'll have *many
  rounds*, each round eliminating *as few* candidates as possible.

  Specifically: we will eliminate candidates one-at-a-time. We will
  eliminate the bottom ranked candidate and have voters vote again. We
  will keep repeating until there are only two candidates left. We know
  that in the final round, no votes are wasted because there are only
  two candidates left.

  Are votes wasted in earlier rounds? In round $k$, imagine that
  candidate X is eliminated. Voters for any other candidate Y did not
  waste their vote: their vote increased Y's margin of victory over
  eliminated candidate X. They helped Y not get eliminated.

  Also, the voters for X did not waste their ballot. They were making
  X's deficit as small as possible. Their vote was helping
  (unsuccessfully) keep X in the race.

  It is true that X is eliminated, but X's supporters can always vote
  for any other candidate in the next round. They did not throw away
  their vote on X, since they get another vote in the next round!

  Imagine what would happen if we applied this system to the French 2002
  election. The less popular candidates of the left and right would be
  eliminated, increasing the vote share of the leading candidates Jospin
  and Chirac. Le Pen's vote share would never rise appreciably above his
  initial 16.68%, since his support comes only from the FN.

  Thus Le Pen would eventually be eliminated in the second-to-last
  round. The final round would be a head-to-head of Jospin and Chirac.

  #### Automating A Multiple Round System: Instant Runoff Voting

  If there is no first-round majority winner, a second round wil have to
  be held. This means the electorate must come out on a second day to
  vote in a second election! If we need to run even more rounds, we'll
  have to have the electorate come out for those, too!

  Could we somehow streamline a multi-round system into just a single
  round?

  The simplest solution is this: ask each voter to *rank* all candidates
  on the ballot. In the initial round, we count all the first-rank
  votes. We eliminate the bottom candidate. In our Florida example,
  Nader is eliminated first.

  We now "simulate" a second round. We count votes again, but we treat
  Nader's votes as if they were submitted for the second-ranked
  candidate. In this case, we're assuming Nader voters would rank Gore
  as second. Thus, in the second round Gore wins 48% of first round
  votes plus the 3% of the Nader supporters' second round votes. This
  gives Gore his 51%-49% victory over Bush.

  Methods that ask voters to *rank* candidates are called *ranked
  choice* systems (there are many such systems). The ranked choice
  system we've described here is simply an automation of the multiple
  round system we've described above. It is called *Instant Runoff
  Voting* (*IRV*).

  #### Where Is Instant Runoff Voting Used?

  Instant Runoff Voting is the system that is used to elect the mayor of
  San Francisco. It is used to elect members of the lower house of
  Australia. Maine will use IRV in 2020 when it votes for president.

  #### Instant Runoff Voting: An Example

  Let's work an example to see IRV in action.

  We should first note: when there are exactly three candidates, instant
  runoff voting is identical to the two round system.

  Let us say that five candidates run for mayor in San Francisco. Alice
  receives 30% of first-choice votes, Bob receives 25% of first-choice
  votes, Candice receives 20% of first-choice votes, David receives 15%
  of votes, and Eve receives 10% of first-choice votes.

  If San Francisco used the FPTP method, Alice would win. If San
  Francisco used the two round system, all but Alice and Bob would be
  eliminated. Depending on how first-choice supporters of Candice,
  David, and Eve ranked Alice and Bob, either could candidate could win.

  Using IRV, Eve is eliminated first, because she has received the
  fewest number of first-choice votes. Let's imagine that David's
  platform is very similar to Eve's. Everyone who ranked Eve first has
  ranked David *second*. Thus, after elimination of Eve, all her
  supporters' votes transfer to David. His share of the vote increases
  to 25%.

  Still, no one has a majority of votes. Candice is the next candidate
  eliminated. Of her supporters, let us imagine that some prefer Alice,
  others prefer Bob, but that David is most popular amongst Candice's
  supporters. Lets say that Candice's supporters splice 5/5/10 for
  Alice/Bob/David.

  Now Alice has 35% of the vote, Bob has 30% of the vote, and David has
  35% of the vote. We eliminate Bob next. Let us say that his votes
  transfer 5% to Alice, and 25% to David. Note that some voters who had
  ranked Candice first and Bob second are having their votes transferred
  a *second time*!

  Now that there are only two candidates remaining, the vote tally in
  the final round is 40% for Alice and 60% for David. David wins!

  #### How Much Would IRV Reduce Spoiling In US Elections?

  We've discussed how IRV reduces the spoiler effect, even when there
  may be a strong third party and many "spoilers." It is nice that
  voters who prefer a "spoiler" can still vote their conscience (e.g.,
  rank Nader first), knowing that this symbolic vote is not wasted.

  On the other hand, I would not want to overdramatize the failure of
  FPTP. Voters can easily identify the top two general election
  candidates in the two party system that prevails in the United States.
  It is a simple (and common) strategy for voters to vote for one of the
  top two candidates even if these are not their first choice. In other
  words: Florida Nader voters knew that they might regret voting for
  Nader. Probably many Nader supporters decided to vote for Gore anyway
  for this very reason.

  Also: in the American two-party system, third party candidates are
  marginal enough that they attract relatively few votes. Thus third
  party candidates can "spoil" only elections that were already very
  close. Nader spoiled an election which was basically 49%/49%/2%. If
  there had been a small tornado in Jacksonville, Bush would have lost.
  If there had been a flood in Miami, it wouldn't matter what Nader
  voters did: Gore would have lost.

  When an election result is close enough that it is not robust to
  normal, random events, the injustice of getting it "wrong" is less. In
  my opinion, the real tragedy of Florida 2000 was that 49% of voters
  wanted to vote for Bush. I'm a lot less angry that Nader and FPTP
  spoiled the election for Gore.

  #### Voter Regret, Head-To-Head Elections, and Condorcet Winners

  **TODO**: Reconsider. I haven't reviewed much past here.

  Let us say that voters for Nader prefer Gore over Markov. Perhaps
  Markov and Nader represent political extremes, while Gore is a
  centrist candidate. Given the vote breakdown, Nader voters would have
  done better to vote for Gore rather than Nader. By switching their
  vote they could put Gore in the lead 55%-to-45%.

  It feels undesirable that Nader voters *regret* their vote for Nader
  (wish they could change their vote to Gore). It gets worse. If Gore
  represents the political center, then Markov voters probably prefer
  Gore to Nader. In that case, Gore would win a head-to-head race
  against Nader 80%-to-20%.

  Gore would beat *every other candidate* if he were in a head-to-head
  race with them. We call Gore the *Condorcet winner* of the election.
  There can be only (at most) one Condorcet winner in an election.

  Speaking loosely/imprecisely, the Condorcet winner (when there is
  one), is the single candidate that "a majority" agrees is better than
  every other candidate. It seems a shame that FPTP can fail to elect
  the Condorcet winner (as in our example).

  #### IRV May Not Particularly Help Centrist Candidates

  Where a polarized two-party system prevails, instant runoff voting
  does not significantly help centrist candidates. Imagine a polarized
  country where diametrically opposed candidates A and B both command
  40% first-rank support. Centrist voters can vote for candidate C, but
  because C is not popular enough to win more first-rank votes, they
  will be the first eliminated under IRV. One of the two polarizing
  candidates (A or B) will be elected (after C's votes are
  redistributed).

  IRV *might* incentivize candidates A and B to appeal to supporters of
  candidate C. It *might* encourage parties A and B to nominate
  candidates who will win C's votes (after redistribution). But (in
  theory) the two party FPTP system already encourages parties to choose
  candidates who appeal to the center.

  In conclusion: I would not expect IRV to greatly help American
  candidates with broad but tepid support. On the other hand, IRV
  wouldn't *harm* centrists/compromise candidates.

  #### IRV Could Help When There Are Many Candidates

  I think the real value of instant runoff voting is in elections where
  there are a large number of candidates, many of whom share supporters.

  We already discussed the 2002 French presidential election. Let's
  consider a second, hypothetical scenario. Imagine a world where there
  are 12 American primary contestants, 11 of whom are near-facsimiles of
  each other. A 12th candidate is named Donald Trump. In this crazy
  world, IRV is not used in presidential primaries. You want to vote
  against Donald Trump. Who do you vote for?

  Do you vote for the candidate you most like? That could help your
  favorite candidate build visibility and momentum, even if they lose
  your state's primary (maybe even getting no delegates).

  Important question: is your state a winner-take-all primary? If so,
  you probably should vote for the non-Trump candidate with the
  strongest support. Without the other candidates' voters banding
  together, Donald Trump will win all the delegates in your state.

  But how can you identify the non-Trump consensus candidate? The more
  similar the leading non-Trump candidates are, the harder it will be
  for never-Trump voters to pick and rally around just one of those
  candidates. Also, candidates have a strong personal incentive
  (professional advancement) not to withdraw unless it is obvious they
  cannot win.

  At least one analysis suggests that [IRV flips most Donald Trump
  Primary Victories][trump-results].

  #### Conclusions

  1. IRV has some advantages (and no obvious disadvantages) when
     compared with FPTP.
  1. Introducing IRV probably wouldn't fundamentally change the two
     party dynamic that prevails in American general elections. IRV
     would eliminate third party candidates and the election would
     mostly reduce to the two main parties (as is already the case).
  1. IRV would presumably reduce the spoiler effect in closely contested
     general elections. This is nice, but not vital. Third-party
     spoilers in the US tend to have low support, so only already
     contentious FPTP elections can be spoiled.
  1. Introducing IRV could reduce the probability that extremist
     candidates are selected in *primary* elections (where there can be
     many similar candidates).

  #### Future Discussion

  There are many other kinds of electoral systems. In the future, I'd
  like to review/consider other systems that achieve *proportional*
  outcomes. That is: if 40% of the electorate support party A and 60%
  support party B, then a *multi-member district* of *ten* seats will
  elect 4 members of party A and 6 members of party B.

  Examples systems that achieve this are:

  1. Party-List Proportional Representation (most legislatures are
     elected this way),
  1. Single Transferrable Vote (Irish legislature elected this way)

  countries organize their federal government. For example: did you know
  On a related note: I'd like to consider and review ways that other
  that most European countries are run by a coalition government? I'd
  like to talk about how that works, and what the advantages of such
  systems might be.

  **TODO**: Why didn't voters focus on one non-Trump candidate in the
  primaries?
